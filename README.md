# Fullstack Auth Starter

A reusable, production-ready authentication starter designed to be used across multiple full-stack projects.

This repository focuses on clean architecture, secure auth flows, and clear documentation, making it easy to plug authentication into future applications.

🎯 Project Goals

Provide a reusable authentication module

Implement secure, real-world auth flows

Keep backend and frontend cleanly separated

Serve as a starter template for future full-stack projects

Be well-documented for long-term maintainability

🧰 Tech Stack
Backend (Implemented)

Node.js

Express.js

MySQL

JWT authentication

bcrypt for password hashing

Frontend (Planned)

React

API-based authentication

Token & session handling

🏗 High-Level Architecture

RESTful API backend handling:

User registration & login

Password reset (forgot/reset flow)

Token-based authentication

Frontend (to be added) will consume the backend API

Backend and frontend are maintained as separate modules
